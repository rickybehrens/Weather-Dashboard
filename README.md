## Information
```
The description of the site is very simple. Upon loading the website you'll see the "Weather Dashboard" banner on top with the "Search for a City" input box and below you have the "Search" button.

If the user has been to the site before and has searched any city in the past, the last 8 cities will appear in blue. These blue buttons, when clicked, beahve as a form of shortcut to the search, giving you the current weather in that city, along ith the 5-day forecast.

If the user has not visited the site before, the history section will be empty and only start showing the cities once the search button has been clicked with the name of the city.

In case the user mispells the name of the city, and error will appear as to show that city's name cannot be found and the mispelled city won't be recorded in the history.

Once the user decides which city he would like to know what the weather will be doing, the user inputs the name of the city and clicks the "Search" button.

The next thing that happens is that name of the city appears on the display on the right, along with the date and what the current weather looks like:
    - Name of the city with today's date
    - Temperature (hi/lo)
    - Wind speed in MPH and the direction which is divided in 16 directions based on the degrees in which the wind is moving to. 
    - Humidity   

Aditionally, the background on the display box changes to show if it's clear, rainy, snowy, windy, foggy, smoky or cloudy.

The 5-Day Forecast shows the same information. it displays the following information:
    - Date
    - Emoji showing if its sunny, rainy, snowy, windy, foggy, smoky or cloudy.
    - Temperature (High) for the day
    - Temperature (Low) for the day
    - Wind speed
    - Humidity

Lastly, there's a banner at the bottom that can display any lastest weather news around the world and can also be used to display any publicity or important messages.
